------------------------------------ In Java 8 ---------------------------
abstract class: Inside abstract class we can declare instance variables, which are required to the child class

Interface: Inside interface every variables is always public static and final we cannot declare instance variables
---------
abstract class: Abstract class can talk about state of object

Interface: Interface can never talk about state of object
---------
abstract class: Inside Abstract class we can declare constructors

Interface: Inside interface we cannot declare constructors as purpose of
constructors is to initialize instance variables. So what is the need of constructor there if we cannot have instance variables in interfaces.
---------
abstract class: Inside abstract class we can declare instance and static blocks

Interface: Interfaces cannot have instance and static blocks.
---------
abstract class: Abstract class cannot refer lambda expression

Interfaces: Interfaces with single abstract method can refer lambda expression
---------
abstract class: Inside abstract class we can override OBJECT CLASS methods

Interfaces: We cannot override OBJECT CLASS methods inside interfaces.
