# Creational
These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation.<br /> <br /> 
  --> Factory Method <br />
  --> Abstract Factory <br />
  --> Builder  <br />
  --> Singleton <br />
  --> Object Pool <br />
  --> Prototype <br />

### Factory-method

In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

Factory Method can be used along with the Iterator pattern to let collection subclasses return proper iterators.

### Abstract-factory

Abstract Factory design pattern is one of the Creational pattern. Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern. Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.

Abstract factory pattern implementation provides us a framework that allows us to create objects that follow a general pattern. So at runtime, abstract factory is coupled with any desired concrete factory which can create objects of desired type.
