# Creational

### factory-method
In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

Factory Method can be used along with the Iterator pattern to let collection subclasses return proper iterators.
